# Dota 2 Hero Randomizer for the Yarowoi Challenge

![Screenshot of the interface](img/screenshot.png)
Built with love ❤️ for [YAROWOI](https://www.twitch.tv/yarowoiqa).

## The Challenge

The idea is to get four random heroes one from each attribute and then choose one to play. If hero is banned, you can click on it to reroll. The ultimate challenge is to reach the Titan rank using this method.

In addition to the random heroes, you can also take on an additional challenge that is randomly assigned to each hero. If necessary, you can click on the challenge tile and reroll it!

Dare to try?!!
