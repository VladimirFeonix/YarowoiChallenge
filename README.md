# Dota 2 Hero Randomizer

This is a Dota 2 hero randomizer created for the [Yarowoi Challenge](https://www.twitch.tv/yarowoiqa).

The idea is to get four random heroes, one from each attribute, and then choose one to play. If a hero is banned, you can click on it to reroll. The ultimate challenge is to reach the Titan rank using this method.
